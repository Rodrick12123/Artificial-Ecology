This ecology involves organism 1 which is represented by blue tiles, organism 2 which is represented by red tiles, and the evolution of organims 2 through canibalism which is represented by green tiles. Organism 1 can reprodcuce on its own while organism two including its evolved version must reproduced by consuming another organim. The original organism 2 cannot consume its own species, but the evolved org 2 can consume any species in the ecology, which gives it a natural advantage in its reproduction. This ecosytem represents how canabilistic organism gain a natural advantage in any ecosytem.
