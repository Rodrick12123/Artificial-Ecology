This ecology involves organism 1 which, is represented by blue tiles, organism 2 which, is represented by red tiles, and the evolution of organism 2 through cannibalism, which is encoded with green tiles. Organism 1 can reproduce on its own, while organism two, including its evolved version, can only be reproduced by consuming another organism. The original organism 2 cannot consume its species, but the evolved org 2 can eat any species in the ecology, which gives it a natural advantage in its reproduction. This ecosystem represents how cannibalistic organisms gain a natural advantage in a limited ecosystem.
