      This ecology involves organism 1 which is represented by blue tiles, 
      organism 2 which is represented by red tiles, and the evolution of organims 
      2 through canibalism which is represented by green tiles. 
      Organism 1 can reprodcuce on its own while organism two including its evolved 
      version must reproduced by consuming another organim. The original organism 2 
      cannot consume its own species, but the evolved org 2 can consume any species 
      in the ecology, which gives it a natural advantage in its reproduction. This 
      ecosytem represents how canabilistic organism gain a natural advantage in any 
      ecosytem.
